### Welcome to my GitHub

- I‚Äôm the Product Lead at [@amazee.io](github.com/amazeeio) - formerly Tech Lead at [@GovCMS](github.com/govcms) and [@data.gov.au](github.com/datagovau)

- We're currently working on building the world's most amazing fully Open Source container build, deploy and host platform [@Lagoon](github.com/amazeeio/lagoon) - check it out!

- We're working with a number of awesome equally open source partners and from time to time I'll make sure to give some of my time back to them!

- In the past I've contributed a lot of time to (and been involved in the development of) a number of Australian whole-of-government projects:
  - [GovCMS](github.com/govcms)
  - [NationalMap](github.com/TerriaJS/nationalmap)
  - [TerriaJS](github.com/TerriaJS/terriajs)
  - [magda](github.com/magda-io/magda)

- When i'm not stuck in front of a screen, I like to get out and about - walking our üêï, running üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è or ~~riding~~ falling off bicycles üö¥

- We regularly hold "Office Hours" open sessions to let people come and ask us questions about Lagoon, Container Hosting, being Open Source and lots more - follow the links/sites above to find out when they're on, or just drop me a line.
