### Welcome to my GitHub

- I’m the Head of Engineering at [@amazee.io](github.com/amazeeio) - formerly Tech Lead at [@GovCMS](github.com/govcms) and [@data.gov.au](github.com/datagovau)

- We're currently working on building the world's most amazing fully Open Source container build, deploy and host platform [@Lagoon](github.com/uselagoon) - check it out!

- We're working with several excellent, equally open source partners, and from time to time, I'll make sure to give some of my time back to them!

- In the past, I've contributed a lot of time to (and been involved in the development of) several Australian whole-of-government projects:
  - [GovCMS](github.com/govcms)
  - [NationalMap](github.com/TerriaJS/nationalmap)
  - [TerriaJS](github.com/TerriaJS/terriajs)
  - [magda](github.com/magda-io/magda)

- When I'm not stuck in front of a screen, I like to get out and about - walking our 🐕, running 🏃‍♂️ or ~~riding~~ falling off bicycles 🚴

- Check out my amazee.io [bio page](https://www.amazee.io/about-us/people/toby-bellwood), or find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tobybellwood) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tobybellwood/)

- We regularly hold "Office Hours" open sessions to let people come and ask us questions about Lagoon, Container Hosting, being Open Source, and lots more - follow the links/sites above to find out when they're on, or just drop me a line.
